This project is a Rust ML training and running library.

This library will contain high-level abstractions to make ML model development and usage easy and compute efficient.

The priorities of this library are compute efficiency first, ease of use second.

The current focus of the library will be CUDA support. As Vulkan compute turns from discussion to spec, support will be added.

The project aims to have abstractions at a level similar to PyTorch.
